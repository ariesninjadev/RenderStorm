## About The Project

Renderstorm is the latest Renderer in my collection (the 11th to be exact). It upgrades technology used in previous renderers, and in the process upgrades my learning of modern technologies, including OpenGL which is used in this project.

My last renderer used Java's AWT, and it taught me a lot about Linear Algebra and 3d projection since I had to write all of these methods manually, but it was extremely computationally inefficient. This project instead uses OpenGL, and I'll hopefully be able to do a lot more with it.
